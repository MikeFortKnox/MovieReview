# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is my Movie Review App. Users will be able to select a movie from a search bar, rate and review those movies. Each movie can be searched by title and can be specified by the year it was released. The selected movie will provide a brief summary, cast, director, and IMDb rating.

Languages used: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
